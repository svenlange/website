<h1 itemprop="headline">Why use continuous integration</h1>

<p>Again and again I see myself in annoying long discussions about putting up a CI for projects or not. I guess many people already wrote about exactly the same thing, but i want to sum up all the pros and cons here for myself.</p>

<p>Pro:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The CI builds on a dedicated system
        <ul>
            <li>Not checked in files lead to a failing build</li>
            <li>The build server usually is building and running its test on a system that is very similar to the production system. This can prevent you from very nasty bugs that appear while you are trying to depoly your software on a production machine</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Statistics and history
        <ul>
            <li>One can see how stable a certain test is</li>
            <li>Which developer causes the most trouble by not properbly checking in its code</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Nightly stage
        <ul>
            <li>A customer or product owner can see the software evolving in almost real time</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Con:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The CI server needs some hardware and someone to set everything up and keep the CI running</li>
</ul>

<p>In my optinion a CI server is not only for teams. Even if the development team consists of a single person a CI gives you a lot of benefits as listed above.</p>
