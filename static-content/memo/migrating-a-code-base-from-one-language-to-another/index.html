<h1 itemprop="headline">Migrating a code base from one language to another</h1>

<p itemprop="description">During 2012 I migrated a Xpand and Xtend1 code base to its successor Xtend2, today simply called <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/xtend/">Xtend</a>. During the project I made the folllowing experiences.</p>


<ul>
    <li>First try to clean up the old code base a little before starting to migrate! Small stuff will help already.
        <ul>
            <li>Talk to the developers involved in the project and ask for stuff that isnt used or needed anymore. There will be planty. And wasting time on this is just nonsense.</li>
            <li>Try to find duplicated code.</li>
            <li>Try to reduce the dependencies between classes, modules etc.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Always have a running system while migrating. Use an adapter for example to iterativly replace the old system step by step with the new one until the migration is 100% completed.</li>
    <li>Do small noninvasive changes. Migrate the smallest file with smallest possible impact first.</li>
    <li>Write many tests to prove that the behavior of the migrated code is the same.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Don't do any refactorings on your way!!!</strong></em> Don't do it! First successfully complete the migration and write lots of tests. Only afterwards do refactor the migrated code.</li>
</ul>
