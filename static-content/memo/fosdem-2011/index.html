<h1 itemprop="headline">FOSDEM 2011</h1>

<p>This january I attended the <a href="http://www.fosdem.org">FOSDEM</a> in Brussels for the first time. Before I only visited those expensive enterprise conferences like JAOO, JAX and the like. It really was a great experience. A free conference (in terms of registrations fees) about free and open source software. I hope I can attend it next year again.</p>

<p>I stayed at the <a href="http://wiki.debian.org/Java/DevJam/2011/Fosdem">Java Dev-Room</a> for most of the time. The speakers there were not the best presenters (cause they are real geeks) but still they gave me inspiration and I could widen my horizon by learning new stuff from them.</p>

<p>One nice thing was that some companies (Oracle, <a href="http://www.tarent.de/web/tarent/home">tarent</a>, ...) were sponsoring a dinner. The conversations with the participating Java folks were very nice. We talked a little about everything concerning IT stuff. From different hardware architectures to design patterns and political stuff.</p>

<p>One neat tool I have to look into is <a href="http://sourceware.org/systemtap/">SystemTap</a>. It enables one to do sophisticated application diagnosis on a Linux OS. For example trace down a Java method call through the JVM down to the native system call. Pretty detailed and interesting tool if one is faced with very tricky performance or functional problems.</p>
