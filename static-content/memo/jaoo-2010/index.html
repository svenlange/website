<p itemprop="description">My visit at the JAOO 2010 conference</p>


<p>This years JAOO conference was quite nice again. I was not able to attend all the sessions I wanted to, but just being there and meeting new people is worth it already. For example <a href="http://nighthacks.com">Mr. Gosling</a>. ;-) Or of cause <a href="http://rohdef.dk">Rohde</a> who was so kind to give us a place to stay during the conference. Thanks mate.</p>

<p>What I really have to look into is how concurrent programming will be done in the future on the Java platform. Brian Goetz did a really <a href="http://gotocon.com/aarhus-2010/presentation/Data%20parallelism%20in%20Java">interesting talk</a> about this topic.</p>

<p>Besides that I couldn't get more inspiration from this years conference. But that is OK. Denmark is a great country and it is always a good thing to stop by. After the conference I had some time to travel up to Aalborg and Skagen and then drive back to Germany along the Danish coast side visiting Klitm√∏ller etc.</p>
