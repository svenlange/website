<h1 itemprop="headline">Generating UML class diagrams from Grails domain model</h1>

<p itemprop="description">This memo show how to generate UML diagrams from a Grails domain model by comparing two Grails plugins.</p>



<p>Today I tried some Grails plugins that generate UML class diagrams from the existing domain model in an Grails application. I found the following two plugins in the offical Grails plugin repository to play with.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/create-domain-uml">Create Domain UML 0.5</a> created by Al Phillips (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/grails-domain-uml/">Source code</a>)</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/class-diagram">Class diagram plugin 0.4.1</a> created by <a href="http://trygveamundsen.blogspot.com">Trygve Amundsen</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The application I used is a small book management app that manages a couple hundred books at my workplace.</p>

<h3>Create Domain UML plugin</h3>
<p>First I tried the <em>Create Domain UML</em> plugin. This plugin is very easy to install and actually consists only of one custom Grails  script called CreateDomainUml.groovy.</p>

<p>To generate the diagram the<a href="http://yuml.me/"> yuml.me</a> service is used. The service is totally free according to the faq section. But still his  might be a problem for some people as they cant send any source codes of there program across the internet. Well, you could run your own yuml service by <a href="http://yuml.me/getit">buying the software</a> and run it on an internal server.</p>

<p>To install the plugin into your Grails application simply enter the following command line command.</p>

<pre>
grails install-plugin create-domain-uml
</pre>

<p>To generate a class diagram just enter:</p>

<pre>
grails create-domain-uml
</pre>

<p>Ok enough texting. Let's see what the plugin can do for us.</p>

<img src="scroffyCreateDomainUMLPlugin.png" alt="Scroffy Top Down class diagram" width="683" height="701" />

<img src="createDomainUMLPlugin.png" alt="Orderly Top Down class diagram" width="683" height="701" />

<p>The plugin creates a HTML-File and puts it into the applications root folder. On the page you see four links directing to www.yuml.me. Two of them will generate a Top Down class diagram (scroffy/orderly) as you can see above and the the other two a Right Left version of the class diagram (scroffy/orderly).</p>

<h3 id="pluginBoxTitle">Class diagram plugin</h3>

<p>Second up to try the <em>Class diagram plugin.</em> This plugin is not that easy to install. First you need to download and install <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>. Graphviz is an open source graph visualization software licensed under the Common Public License Version 1.0.</p>

<p>The installation can be triggered by executing the following command line command.</p>

<pre>
grails install-plugin class-diagram
</pre>

<p>After some configuring and starting up your Grails application class diagrams can be generated by invoking <em>http://localhost:8080/classDiagram</em>. The result could look like the following.</p>

<img src="classDiagramPlugin.png" alt="Class diagram generated by Class Diagram Plugin" width="411" height="651" />

<p>The plugin comes with a mass of config possibilities I had not a deep look into. There you can change the diagrams direction (TopDown/RightLeft), appearance and level of detail.</p>

<p>Little downsite of the plugins is that its views depend on JQuery so might look ugly without. But it is still possible to generate the desired diagram.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/create-domain-uml">Create Domain UML</a> is way easier to install and has fancy but not so detailed diagrams.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.grails.org/plugin/class-diagram">Class diagram plugin</a> is not so easy to install and has a lot configs. The diagram itself does not look so nice but is more detailed.</p>

<p>For my docs I used <em>Class diagram plugin</em> although it doesn't look so neat. For me it was more important that the diagram shows all details of the model.</p>

<p>Hopefully we will see some improvements to the <em>Create Domain UML</em> plugin, because it is easy to use and looks nice.</p>
